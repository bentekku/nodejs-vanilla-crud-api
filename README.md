# Nodejs RestFul CRUD API
> This is vanilla Node.js CRUD API movie project.This project was created only using nodejs, no frameworks or libraries were utilized.
## [Introduction](#Introduction)
 This project contains `memes.json` which is essentially used as the data block for the api, new data can be added, existing data can be update, existing data can be removed, by using the appropriate http request methods (can be found right under the Routes sub-heading).
>It's the first pure/vanilla nodejs project that I have done. It was really hard to grasp most of the concepts, but it all made sense in the end. However, it is certain I do have to code more APIs to brush up my understanding of nodejs concepts.
